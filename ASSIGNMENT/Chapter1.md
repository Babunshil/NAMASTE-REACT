### Q.1) What is Emmet ?

> Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files

### Q.2) Difference between a Library and Framework?

* Library:
> A library is a collection of pre-written code or software modules that provide specific functionalities,such as data manipulation, networking, or user interface components. It typically consists of a set of functions, classes, or methods that developers can use to perform specific tasks in their programs. Libraries are usually focused on providing reusable code for specific purposes, and developers can include them in their projects by importing or linking to the library. Libraries often offer flexibility and allow developers to choose which components or functions to use based on their needs.

* Libraries:
> * NumPy: A popular library for numerical computing in Python. It provides efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations.
> * React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage component state.
> * Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It offers high-level data structures and functions to handle and analyze structured data.
> * Retrofit: A library for making HTTP requests in Android applications. It simplifies the process of interacting with RESTful APIs by providing a high-level abstraction.

* Framework:
> A framework, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive and structured software tool that provides a foundation or skeleton for building applications. It includes a set of libraries, tools, and conventions that guide developers in designing and developing applications within a specific domain. Frameworks define the overall structure, architecture, and flow of an application, and they often impose certain constraints or rules to enforce best practices. Developers build their applications by extending or customizing the framework's predefined classes, methods, and components.

* Frameworks:
> * Django: A high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a complete solution for building web applications, including an ORM, templating engine, and routing system.
> * Ruby on Rails: Also known as Rails, it is a web application framework written in Ruby. Rails follows the convention-over-configuration principle and provides a set of tools and libraries for building database-backed web applications.
> * Angular: A TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications. Angular provides a robust structure for creating complex, single-page applications with features like data binding, dependency injection, and component-based architecture.
> * Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of server-side applications and APIs by providing a lightweight and flexible set of features for routing, middleware handling, and request/response handling.
